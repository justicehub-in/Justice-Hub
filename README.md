Justice-Hub is an initiative from [CivicDataLab](https://www.civicdatalab.in) in collaboration with [Agami](https://www.agami.in/). The hub initiated as part of the [Agami data challenge -2019](https://www.agami.in/data-challenge-2019). Justice Hub is a collaborative data platform that focuses on legal and justice related datasets and other resources. Our objective is to build a common platform for members of the legal data and tech community (civil society organizations, researchers, journalists, law firms etc.) to share, build and collaborate on the common resources.
